SimplestScrollViewPossible
==========================

The simplest UIScrollView Possible.

ScrollViews with autoLayout are deceptively difficult. If you go to https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2154/_index.html and use any other than a UIImageView, you'd quickly be scratching your head as to why it's not working. This wastes quite a bit of time and effort, even for experienced programmers.

Though it is possible to make UIScrollView work without the PureLayout library used in this example, I believe there is little reason not use the best tools available - especially when they result in concise, understandable code.

I hope this will be the first is a long series of SimpestWhateverPossible projects

Prerequisites :

Install CocoaPods. If you don't have CocoaPods dependency manager, you're missing out. Quick and painless, as well as amazing. http://cocoapods.org/ Just remember, you'll be opening the .xcworkspace files instead of the usual .xcodeproj.

Install PureLayout. Actually, this project already has that installed, so you're set.
